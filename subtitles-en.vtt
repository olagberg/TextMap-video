00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:02.600
Lars is a guy in his early thirties.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.040
He likes to enjoy a cup of coffee at his favorite
café by himself,

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.780
but after he developed social anxiety he started
to avoid doing his favorite pastime.

4
00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.010
But all this changed once he was introduced
to the app “TextMap”.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.630
TextMap lets him know where the closest restaurants
and cafés are,

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.440
shows him said places’ menus,
including an indoor map of the areas.

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.600
Lars thinks it’s a good idea that he can
check the menu without having to enter the café first,

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.400
because this gives him the opportunity to decide what he wants in advance

9
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.700
without having to stand around awkwardly in the café.

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.200
He also isn’t forced to ask someone where
the toilets are

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.030
because the indoor map shows him where they’re located.

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.109
This gives him the sense of safety he needs
to be able to enjoy the trip.

13
00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.329
Stine is a woman in her late thirties.

14
00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.210
She was born with Retinitis Pigmentosa, also
called “tunnel vision”.

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.299
This condition makes her vision slowly decline
over time.

16
00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.629
Before she went completely blind she used
a zooming-function on her phone that let her

17
00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.629
read signs and menus.

18
00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.460
She dreaded the time she would lose her vision,
until she was educated in how to use TextMap.

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.499
TextMap has a camera function that can translate
pictures into text,

20
00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:05.180
like pictures of menus and signs.

21
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.840
The translation can then be read out loud
for the user.

22
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.890
Even if Stine is blind, she still knows exactly
where to find the toilets in public places

23
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.439
thanks to TextMap.

24
00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:19.200
This is because TextMap gives her an explanation
on how to get to the restroom based on her position.

25
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.380
Today, Stine is an active user of TextMap
and contributes by adding more menus,

26
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.900
danger signs and indoor maps for other users
to make use of.

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.570
Gloria’s first trip to Norway was a nightmare.

28
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.110
Most of the signs she came across were written
in Norwegian, which made it difficult for

29
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.140
her to navigate around by herself.

30
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.350
Thankfully, Gloria is a super optimistic person
and found Norway to be a beautiful country

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.329
regardless of its flaws, so she decided to
come back to Norway for another trip.

32
00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.819
This time around she’s in the know about
TextMap, which can help her out by not only

33
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.920
making pictures into text, but also translate
said text directly through the app.
